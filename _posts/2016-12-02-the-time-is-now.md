# Why we do What we do

I asked ONE question at the right time, and I saved a family member from a fatal drug overdose.

I set board protocols and leadership transition in an M&A deal in healthcare. Since then, have immersed in patient safety research, engaging with some of the foremost experts, researchers and advocates in the field.

We are building a team of deep technology and patient safety experts with a view to equip the common healthcare consumer to take charge of their own safety and quality of care. This has profound implications for how the business will be structured.
