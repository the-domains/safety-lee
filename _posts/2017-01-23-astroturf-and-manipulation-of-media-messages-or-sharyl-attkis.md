# Your Informed Consent is 'manufactured'?

The informed consent you sign presently in your journey in healthcare is a legal/regulatory requirement intended to protect a consumer's right but executed so as to protect the healthcare industry against liability.

> What's missing is the prelude to Informed Consent, better described as an environment in which you have an Informed Conversation / Consultation / Collaboration with your healthcare professional - An environment designed to enable a systematic improvement in quality of care and outcome, while reducing scope for patient harm (medical error) and cost escalation

### So how does an ideal environment for Informed Consultation look like?

**Transparency: **Your doctor discloses upfront both monetary and non-monetary benefits received from providers, insurers, and pharmaceutical / device manufacturers.

**Documentation:** Your doctor allows you to record (video / audio) your interactions with them during consultation or surgery, and provides access in real time to their notes and reports.

**Duration: **Your healthcare professional takes the time to listen deeply and answer questions. They do not discourage you from doing your own research, and substantiate their assertions with factual references. The time spent by your physician or surgeon is directly correlated with improved patient safety. Since time is money, the top paid medical professionals often can't match the outcomes of those who prioritize for patient safety by spending more time with their patients.
