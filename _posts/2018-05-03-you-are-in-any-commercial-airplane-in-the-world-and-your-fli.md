# The Missing Red Flags: Why you need Worldwide and People-Driven Patient-Safety Announcements

You are in any commercial airplane in the world and your flight is experiencing turbulence.

Close Your Ears, What Do You See?

You see that the captain has turned the seatbelt sign on. In addition, you are asked to get back to your seat and fasten your seatbelt.

Why?

There is a chance that you may get thrown around in the turbulence and you MAY suffer injury, sometimes fatal. Probability of dying in an air crash? 1 in x.

You are crossing the road on the zebra line at a traffic junction.

Close Your Ears. What Do You See?

You see a red light to keep you from crossing when motor vehicles are passing. You see a green light when it is SAFE for YOU to cross. Probability of dying in a road accident? 1 in w.

You are at the MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) train station in Singapore and about to enter a train.

Close Your Eyes, What Do You Hear?

You hear that you should watch out for the gap between the platform and the door. Why? There is a chance that your foot may slip into the gap between the platform and the door, and you MAY suffer injury, sometimes serious and rarely fatal. Probability of dying in a train? 1 in y

You are in a hospital for a basic surgical procedure.

Open Your Eyes and Ears, What Do You See? What Do You Hear?

There is a patient who has died of pneumonia contracted while in the hospital. He did not have pneumonia when he came to the hospital. This is called Hospital Acquired Infection (HAI), a totally preventable death. But it has happened and there is a chance that you can suffer from a similar HAI as well. But you hear nothing. You see nothing. Probability of dying due to medical error in a hospital? 1 in z

Introducing SafetyLee. A real-time early warning system to help you escape harm in healthcare. When your colleagues, neighbours, near and dear use it, everybody gets safer. How? When one of them suffers one kind of issue in healthcare, all who go through THAT kind of issue sees or hears a RED FLAG of WHAT to look out for and HOW to prevent THAT from happening to them.

It's systematic.

Reliable and Resilient.

Works only for YOU, the patient, the healthcare consumer.

it's your right.

We don't take money from the industry.

We take 3$/month from YOU to work for you. ONLY YOU!

So if there's an expensive way for clinics or hospitals to screw your health, we are going to tell you so.

If there's a cheap way to improve your health, we are going to tell you so.

When we say WE, we mean we draw intel from patient safety experts (researchers, doctors or MDs) and patient safety advocates (people who have suffered or lost loved ones or have ones affected), who have raised a RED FLAG saying something is terribly wrong, with proof as to HOW, and therefore provide guidance as to how YOU or YOUR near and dear could escape from a similar kind of circumstance.

Vaccines save lives. MMR vaccines are safe.

Yes, vaccines save lives. No, MMRs are not safe. See the documentary Vaxxed - From Controversy To Catastrophe. There are paediatricians who used to believe MMRs were safe. They saw the documentary, realised how their belief was manipulated. They have changed their stance. They continue to believe vaccines DO save lives. They CERTAINLY also know that there is a strong correlation between the advent of MMR and Autism. And they have changed their advice to patients in accordance. So, when autism has spread from 1 in 15000 to 1 in 45 over a short few decades in the US and poised to become 1 in 2 by 2032, we have ONE paediatrician who has chosen to forego the incentives (payout) from the industry and advice his patients from a safety point of view. A point of view which puts YOUR children above his financial interests. Listen to this podcast where he is interviewed on how out of more that 13000 children under his purview, none have been diagnosed with Autism. While 1 in 45 children in the US continue to be diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.

Listen to this podcast to know how this paediatrician is different.

Watch this documentary to know how the regulator and the industry misled the public.
